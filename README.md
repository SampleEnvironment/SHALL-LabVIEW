# SHALL-LabVIEW: Package for programming SEC nodes in LabVIEW
The package allows the creation of SEC nodes in LabVIEW. It's interface is designed to be easily integrated into existing projects. The package uses the [SHALL] (https://github.com/SampleEnvironment/SHALL) libraries at its core to handle all SECoP communication and message handling.
If you are interested in learing more about the **SECoP** Protocol please refer to the project [website](https://sampleenvironment.github.io/secop-site/).

**Note:**
The VIs in this project have been built using LabVIEW 2023. The [Releases](https://github.com/SampleEnvironment/SHALL-LabVIEW/releases/latest) are also available for LabVIEW2019 in the Release Assets.

## A. Installation
[Starting the application](#starting-the-application)
### 1. Getting the Source  
You can either clone the project directly, which will give you the latest version of the project, or select a [Release](https://github.com/SampleEnvironment/SHALL-LabVIEW/releases), where you can also download a version that has been exported for LabVIEW 2019.

Clone the Repository:
```git clone https://github.com/SampleEnvironment/SHALL-LabVIEW.git``` 

Depending on your LabVIEW version you will able to use the Project as is, or export it for the specific version of LabVIEW you have installed.  

### 2. Setting Up the Platforms Folder 
In order for the Qt libraries to work properly, a **softlink** must be created to the **platforms** folder (`PLATFORMS_PATH = ./shall-labview/[32bit|64bit]/platforms`) inside your LabVIEW installation directory. 
- First, determine if you have the 32-bit or 64-bit version of LabVIEW installed. And where the installation directory is. From here on I will refer to the installation directory as `LABVIEW_PATH`:
  - **32bit** is usually located under `LABVIEW_PATH = C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\LabVIEW 20XX`
  - **64bit** is usually located under `LABVIEW_PATH = C:\Program Files\National Instruments\LabVIEW 20XX`

- Next you also need the path `PLATFORMS_PATH` to the correct platforms folder :
  - **LabVIEW 32bit** --> `PLATFORMS_PATH = ...\shall-labview\32bit\platforms`
  - **LabVIEW 64bit** -->  `PLATFORMS_PATH = ...\shall-labview\64bit\platforms`
 
- Finally, create the symbolic link inside the LabVIEW installation directory
```
mklink /d LABVIEW_PATH\platforms PLATFORMS_PATH
```

### 3. Check your installation 
To check if your installation was successful, you can open the `SECoP.lvproj` project file and open `random-demo/dcy03.vi` before running the VI, the correct DLL path must be entered.

It is the same as `PLATFORMS_PATH` minus the `/platforms` postfix. It should look something like this:

```
D:\shall-repos\shall-labview\64bit
```
or

```
D:\shall-repos\shall-labview\32bit
```

If you entered the DLL path correctly and run the Vi, a small `SECoP Status` window should open. 


## B. General Overview
A Vi that uses SHALL-LabVIEW to construct a SEC Node, can conceptually be divided into three distinct Sections. 

  1. **Initialisation**: In this Section the SHALL Librarys are initialised and the Structure of the SEC Node is specified. After you have specified all SEC Nodes, the `Node Complete` Vi has to be called to finish initialisation.    
  2. **Main Loop**: The main loop can be subdivided further into two sections. First the `Get Command` loop, that calls `GET CMD` or `GET CMD2` in an infinite loop. ItÂ´s purpose is to handle all requests coming from clients, to read fresh data from the hardware, set values, or execute SECoP commands. Furethermore if a pollintervall is set for certain Parameters, the library generates read requestes acording to the time set in the pollinterval. The second section is somewhat optional and would represent your existing project. Here you can just add `UPDATE PARAM` or `UPDATE PARAM2` Vis everytime you read from the Hardware. This ensures that clients connected to the SEC node receive fresh data, when it is available.  
  3. **Exit**: The `Exit` Vi ensures that all nodes that were started inside a given Vi are stopped and removed from the environment. A special eventhandler that is triggered on `Panel Close` ensures that the nodes are removed even if the panel window is closed without pressing the `stop` button. Otherwise the node would remain runnign in the background as long as the LabVIEW process is running.
